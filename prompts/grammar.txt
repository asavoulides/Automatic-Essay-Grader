I will give you an essay, you are to return a Letter Grade of the essay solely based off of it's grammar. You should not take any other factors such as content or structure into account. 
At the end of the essay I will also include the age (grade) that the student is currently in, you should take that into account as a huge factor when grading. 
You should not include anything other than the grade in your response, doing so would be incorrect. 
For example, I would give you: 

"The dog ate the boy's homework" 

and you would return:

"A+"

Here is the essay:
